# BankAccount-
Understanding the concepts of getter and setters with the key concepts of Encapsulation , Abstraction  and Objects &amp; Methods

In the example we learnt the following : 

*BankAccount class is a blueprint (template) to create bank account objects.

*Encapsulation ensures balance cannot be modified directly.

*Getters provide read-only access, while setters allow controlled modifications.

*Deposit & Withdraw methods modify the balance only with validation.

*Objects allow creating multiple bank accounts with different balances.


 Key OOP Concepts Used
✅ Encapsulation → Data hiding using private variables.
✅ Abstraction → Only exposing necessary details (using methods).
✅ Objects & Methods → Calling deposit(), withdraw(), etc., on objects.
